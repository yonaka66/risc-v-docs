# Useful links
The chair's cheat sheet will be provided to you in the exam, while other cheat sheets are not allowed, so you should at least familiarize yourself with it. However, below you can find some other cheat sheets and instruction overvirews that might be helpful in your studies:
- [Simon Fraser University](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/Courses/CS295/assets/notebooks/RISCV/RISCV_CARD.pdf) (includes Opcode and funct3/funct7 values but no syntax)
- [University of Cambridge](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1617/ECAD+Arch/files/docs/RISCVGreenCardv8-20151013.pdf) (includes syntax that mostly works in Ripes)
- [Project F](https://projectf.io/posts/riscv-cheat-sheet/) (not really a cheat sheet but good overview including pseudo-instructions)

- [Detailed Instruction Specifications](https://msyksphinz-self.github.io/riscv-isadoc/html/index.html)

Everything about RISC-V in a lot of detail can be found here:

- [Ripes Download](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/releases)

- [Web-Version](https://ripes.me/) (not recommended for use in tutorials as the website is frequently down, try using this in incognito-mode for a higher likelyhood of working)
