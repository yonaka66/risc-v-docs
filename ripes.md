# Ripes Set-Up and Help
The chair of Computer Security has their own Ripes version that can be accessed and/or downloaded directly through moodle. The version is optimized for usage in this course.

However, you may also use the [original version](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/releases).

Before beginning to write your own programs, it might be helpful to have a look at our example programs: [Parity Bit Calculator](example1.md), [Factorial Calculator](example2.md) and [Pseudo-Random Number Generator](example3.md). These programs are also directly available in our Ripes version (File > Load Example).


#### Set-Up
If you are using the chair's Ripes version it is already fully set up for use in this course. Nevertheless, it might be helpful to switch the processor or enabled extensions throughout the semester as needed.

- **Select processor**: The single cycle/5-stage processor can be selected via the processor-icon in the toolbar.

- **M-Extension**: The M-Extension can be enabled/disabled via the processor-icon in the toolbar.

- **Input type** (original version only): The input language can be set to assembly in the editor tab, by selecting assembly as input type. The setting is available above the "source code"-field.

- **Disassembled pseudo-instructions**: pseudo-instructions can be viewed as disassembled code within the executable code window of the editor tab, by selecting disassmbled view. The setting is available above the "executable code"-field.

- **Displayed values**: The display type of registers can be changed using the "display type"-menu below the register view.

- **Execute Code**: A program can be executed by pressing the green arrow in the toolbar. It can also be executed step-by-step using the black arrows next to it.

- **Example Programs**: The example programs can be accessed via File > Load Example.

- **Label Addresses**: The memory addresses of all used labels can be viewed via the Compass-Button next to the disassembled view.

- **Processor-, Cache- and Memory-Tabs**: Other than the editor, Ripes also provides tabs for a detailed CPU view, cache and memory allocations. These might be helpful throughout the semester.
